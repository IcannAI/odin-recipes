# odin-recipes
In this project, I will demonstrate the workflow in the git. 

The first step is to create a new repo for the project of Odin-recipes on Github platform.  

THe Git commands are to be run from the project folder. In another words, move the repos onto the local machine. The command line is "cd [Project name]/" 

Cloning the project from GitHub with SSH. The command line is "git clone git@github.com:[username]/[Project name].git

After building the [git add + git commit] cycles, I push it up to Github with the command line "git push origin main". 

The second step is to build initial structure. Within the [Project name] directory, create an index.html file and add elements to the body of HTML.
